# Kafitos Sammelsurium
A collection of scripts / utilities that I worked on that are not worthy of own
repositories (yet).

## lacl
Launch And Control Later - a pure bash process launcher that allows for
deferred terminal connections via built-in facilities.

[lacl README](lacl.d)

## fuzzyKeepass
An experiment to implement fuzzy matching logic with regular expressions
motivated by the need to have access to my keepass password database from the
command line (without a GUI).
