# realpicocms - serving "static" as in "aesthatic"
# https://github.com/Kafito/realpicocms
#
# A script that avoids the "dynamically serving static files" approach
# of Pico (http://github.com/picocms/Pico.git).
# This script will start Pico in a temporary web server, extract all files
# of the homepage and store them as .hmtl files in a local directory that can
# be served statically.
# It can be called in the context of inotify to rebuild the homepage, when a
# new file is added to the content directory of Pico.
#
# Limitations:
# * Currently, assets and themes are not handled. These need to be copied manually.
# * The static files are stored as ".html" files, but links within Pico are provided
#   without a suffix. This can be changed by adapting the .twig files of the theme.
#
# Disclaimer:
# Currently users of this file most likely will need to adapt not
# only the config variables, but the code was well, as it is tuned for the
# website the author was working on.
